Autocomplete Search Widget

This is a simple autocomplete search widget built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. The widget fetches data from a remote server using AJAX and displays suggestions as the user types in the search box.

- index.html: The HTML markup for the search widget.
- style.css: The CSS styles for the search widget.
- script.js: The JavaScript code that powers the search widget.
- index.php: The PHP script that acts as a proxy to fetch data from a remote server.
To use the widget, simply open the index.html file in your web browser.
